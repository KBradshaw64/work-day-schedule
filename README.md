# work-day-schedule
hour by hour breakdown of daily tasks

## Description
This project was built to create a daily planner that saves previous tasks, shows todays date, and changes the highlight of the task based on the time of day. It is also an exercise to utilize the dayjs API. Some of the functionality may be missing: changing the color highlights of the hour cards based on time.

## Usage
To use, just click inside of the hour box that you would like to assign a task to and type. Then hit the save button on the right side of the box.

## Credits
The only person who actively helped me fix my code was my TA Toacin - and specifically he helped with the syntax in the for loop that saves local data assigned to ID's. Other than that I also looked at another previous students code repo here: https://github.com/sylviaprabudy/work-day-scheduler I tried not to copy word for word and change the code where possible in order to demonstrate my own understanding of the functions used, and specifically avoided copying code that i could not get to work on my own (changing the color of the cards). I also used suggestions from multiple stackoverflow.com threads - for example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2926227/how-to-do-jquery-code-after-page-loading , https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29955085/getting-sibling-text-input-value , and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42213858/how-can-i-get-parent-id-by-onclick-on-a-child-in-js
